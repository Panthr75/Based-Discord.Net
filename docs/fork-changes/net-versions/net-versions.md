title: Changes in support for .NET Versions
---

Some .NET versions have been completely removed from support due to not allowing new readable features in the source code (and nullable of course.). However, newer versions of .NET are supported as well.

- Removed .NET Framework support
- Added .NET 7.0 Support
- .NET 8.0 Support is in progress...
