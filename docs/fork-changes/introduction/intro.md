# Introduction

Welcome! There are quite some extensive changes in this fork that can really be confusing for new users that want to use this library. This fork is specifically used for one of my personal utility libraries called Bonnel.

> [!WARNING]
> Although this fork is not recommended for use in personal projects (due to the untested/new features in this fork), feel free to git clone, build, and compile this fork for your own personal use. (When doing so, use the `bonnel-lib` branch)
